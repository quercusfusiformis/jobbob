Find out how to call jobbob from far away (add to python search dir?)
    DONE: add to PYTHONPATH in .bash_profile
Reorganize jobbob to make him easier to call (package structure)
	Reformat jobbob to separate classes and scripts
		Class design might take a hot second
            Should he be a program with lots of options, or a collection of classes and scripts, called as needed?
                I'm thinking collection of classes called as needed in the interpreter
	Put into package structure
Find out how to do multiprocessing on jobbob so it doesn't take 40 minutes to characterize as dinuclear

Rambling:
    .log files are generally generated any time a .com file is run, but not always (sometimes lone .com files were attempted, but failed fast)
    Should jobbob be able to make a leafdirectory for any kind of file?
        Subclass of leafdirectory for .log files?
            Yes, I like that idea. Flexible
Scope:
    Provide utility classes for managing directories of files
        Classes can be subclassed for each type of file needing to be analyzed
