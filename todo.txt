    Done. Multiprocessing implemented using ProcessPoolExecutor and num_generating_processes.py
Scale the amount of workers used for Branch and Node creation to the amount of Nodes or Leaflets created during the process
Implement moving files based on search results using a FileMover type classes
Implement auto-rerunning files based on failure results (using a script, mixing python and bash?)
